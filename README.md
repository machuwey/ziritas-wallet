# ziritas-wallet
Ziritas is a wallet that strives to offer a better UX for ordinary people to create MOA/WMOA accounts, becuase its strives to become a governance wallet that is easy to use for everyone.

# How do we do it?
We just simply made a sync channel that enables us with one-click link invite all of our friends to our MOA creation session without aasking them for their wallet addresses.

# Worldcoin integration unfinished 🏗️
Imagine there is a MOA with 20 participants, as this is a governance tool it is really important to ensure that each user is a unique human to avoid any kind of bad players
